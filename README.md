# Funnel-Challenge

This is a coding challenge from https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/99d24u/20180822_challenge_366_intermediate_word_funnel_2/

The goal of the challenge is to take a dictionary of words as a text file, take a word as user input, and by using the dictionary find the largest "Word Funnel" for that word. A word funnel is taking away one letter from a word to make another word repeatedly.

As an added challenge, the program then searches through the dictionary to find a word that has a word funnel 10 words long.
